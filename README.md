# minivmac-package

This is a package of tools to assist in bundling classic Mac applications with [Mini vMac](https://www.gryphel.com/c/minivmac/). For modern Mac computers it creates an app bundle that includes the necessary files. For Windows computers it creates a folder with the necessary resources and a `bat` file to launch the `exe`. In both cases Mini vMac will automatically boot from the included `dsk` image.

## Requirements

This has only been tested on a Mac with macOS 14, but creating Windows builds should work on any computer that can run `zsh` scripts.

Mac builds require [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/). In my testing you will need a different version of Xcode, and thus a different version of macOS, depending on what you're trying to build.

- Apple Silicon builds (`mac`): Xcode 12 or later is required. I have mainly 
  tested with Xcode 15.0.1.

- Intel builds (`mac-x86`): Xcode 9.4.1 (on macOS 10.13.6) through 11.7
  (on macOS 11.6.8) works well in my testing. Later versions will create an
  Intel build that does not play sound. Tested with Mini vMac 37.03.

You will also need Python 3 and pbxproj:

  - Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
  - `brew install python`
  - `pip3 install pbxproj`
  - `brew info python` and find the path after the line that says
    "They will install into the site-package directory"
  - Using that path, add this line to `~/.zshrc`:
  `export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:<path>`

## Setting things up

Before you run the script, you'll need to add some files:

- `files/example.config`: A configuration file with various settings used in 
  the build process. The file's base name should match the `file-base` setting 
  in the file. See the example file for the required settings.

- `files/example.dsk`: A bootable disk image that includes your application. 
  This can be created using a standard build of Mini vMac. The file's base name
  should match the `file-base` setting in your `config` file.

- `files/example.iconset`: An `iconset` folder including images for the Mac app 
  icon. The file's base name should match the `file-base` setting in your 
  `config` file. This can be created using [free templates available from 
  Apple](https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/).

- `files/vMac.ROM`: A Mac Plus ROM file.

- `files/wx64/Mini vMac.exe`: A copy of Mini vMac for Windows (64-bit). For 
  best results, use the [variations
  service](https://www.gryphel.com/c/minivmac/vart_srv.html) with these 
  settings: `-br 36 -t wx64 -magnify 1 -speed z -bg 1 -svl 1`. These settings 
  enable magnified mode by default, set the speed to 1Ã—, and set the system 
  volume to 1.

- `source`: The [Mini vMac source 
  code](https://www.gryphel.com/c/minivmac/beta.html). To build a version for 
  Apple Silicon, this must be version 37 or later.

## Building a package

Here's an example command:
`./build.sh --platform mac --config example`

Possible platforms are `mac`, `mac-x86`, or `windows`. The `config` argument
should match the base name of your `config` file (without the extension) in 
the `files` folder.

## Thanks

I was inspired to put this together after seeing how [Sonneveld](https://twitter.com/sonneveld) bundled [The Secret of Donkey Island](https://donkeyisland.zip) with DOSBox. It's a delightful game, you should try it.
